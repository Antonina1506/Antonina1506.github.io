My grandfather lives there. I spend a lot of time outside because the weather was amazing and I tried to relax after hectic days in Moscow. After visiting my grandpa I went to my granny to SaratovThis week the whole country celebrated the 9th of May.. Saratov is quite big and famous city. I really like the architecture of this city and the weather is really nice too. However, when I was there the weather was not really plasant: it was rainy, windy and cold. But it didn’t break my plans and I enjoyed talking with my granny about everything.\nWhat I’ve done these days Even if I had “holidays” I’ve done a lot. Starting with my university studies, I comleted everything for that week for operation systems, prepared for English exam and did some math tasks. I also spend some time doing Korean lessons and started preparation for a new challenge (dialog). Besides, I helped my granny a lot. We’ve cut down a tree, which trew the shadow on granny’s flowers. Then we cleaned a backyard to prepare it all for summer.\nActually, I’ve done everything that I was planning to do, so I can say that this week was relaxing as well as productive.\n  The template is mobile first with a responsive design to ensure that your site looks stunning on every device.

It was first inaugurated in the 15 republics of the Soviet Union, following the signing of the German Instrument of Surrender late in the evening on 8 May 1945 (after midnight, thus on 9 May Moscow Time). The Soviet government announced the victory early on 9 May after the signing ceremony in Berlin. Although the official inauguration occurred in 1945, the holiday became a non-labor day only in 1965, and only in certain Soviet republics.\nCelebration In 1995, as the world celebrated the 50th anniversary of the end of the war, many world leaders converged on Moscow to attend the city’s first state sponsored ceremonies since the fall of the USSR. In 2015 around 30 leaders, including those of China and India, attended the 2015 celebration, while Western leaders boycotted the ceremonies because of the Russian military intervention in Ukraine.\nHoliday traditions   Victory Day Parades Victory Day Parades are military parades that are held on 9 May, particularly in various post-soviet nations such as Russia, Kazakhstan, Belarus, and until 2015, Ukraine.\n  Mass processions The Immortal Regiment (Russian: Бессмертный полк; Bessmertniy Polk) is a massive civil event staged in major cities in Russia and around the world every 9 May. Since it was introduced in 2012, it has been conducted in cities such as Moscow, Washington D.C., Dushanbe, Berlin, and Yekaterinburg. Participants carry pictures of relatives and/or family members who served during the Second World War. The front line of the procession carries a banner with the words Bessmertniy Polk written on it. Up to 12 million Russians have participated in the march nationwide in recent years. Since 2015, the President Vladimir Putin and senior Russian officials have participated in the procession in Moscow.\n  Soviet and post-Soviet symbols associated with the Victory Day   Banner of Victory The Victory Banner refers to the Soviet military banner raised by the Soviet soldiers on the Reichstag building in Berlin on 1 May 1945. Made during the Battle of Berlin by soldiers who created it while under battlefield conditions, it has historically been the official symbol of the Victory of the Soviet people against Nazi Germany.\n  Saint George’s Ribbon The Ribbon of Saint George is a military symbol that dates back to the era of the Russian Empire. It consists of a black and orange bicolour pattern, with three black and two orange stripes. In the early 21st century, it became an awareness ribbon to commemorate the veterans of the war, being recognized as a patriotic symbol.\n    The template is mobile first with a responsive design to ensure that your site looks stunning on every device.

Git was originally designed as a low-level version-control system engine, on top of which others could write front ends, such as Cogito or StGIT. The core Git project has since become a complete version-control system that is usable directly. While strongly influenced by BitKeeper, Torvalds deliberately avoided conventional approaches, leading to a unique design.\nCharacteristics Git’s design is a synthesis of Torvalds’s experience with Linux in maintaining a large distributed development project, along with his intimate knowledge of file-system performance gained from the same project and the urgent need to produce a working system in short order. These influences led to the following implementation choices:\n  Strong support for non-linear development Git supports rapid branching and merging, and includes specific tools for visualizing and navigating a non-linear development history. In Git, a core assumption is that a change will be merged more often than it is written, as it is passed around to various reviewers. In Git, branches are very lightweight: a branch is only a reference to one commit. With its parental commits, the full branch structure can be constructed\n  Distributed development Like Darcs, BitKeeper, Mercurial, Bazaar, and Monotone, Git gives each developer a local copy of the full development history, and changes are copied from one such repository to another. These changes are imported as added development branches and can be merged in the same way as a locally developed branch.\n  Compatibility with existent systems and protocols Repositories can be published via Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), or a Git protocol over either a plain socket or Secure Shell (ssh). Git also has a CVS server emulation, which enables the use of existent CVS clients and IDE plugins to access Git repositories. Subversion repositories can be used directly with git-svn.\n  Data structures In many ways you can just see git as a filesystem—it’s content-addressable, and it has a notion of versioning, but I really designed it coming at the problem from the viewpoint of a filesystem person (hey, kernels is what I do), and I actually have absolutely zero interest in creating a traditional SCM system.\nGit stores each revision of a file as a unique blob. The relationships between the blobs can be found through examining the tree and commit objects. Newly added objects are stored in their entirety using zlib compression. This can consume a large amount of disk space quickly, so objects can be combined into packs, which use delta compression to save space, storing blobs as their changes relative to other blobs.\n  The template is mobile first with a responsive design to ensure that your site looks stunning on every device.

Software for tracking changes in any set of files.","type":"post"},{"authors":["Antonina Parashchenko"],"categories":["programming"],"content":"History In 2002 Aaron Swartz created atx, “the true structured text format”. Swartz and Gruber then worked together to create the Markdown language in 2004, with the goal of enabling people “to write using an easy-to-read and easy-to-write plain text format, optionally convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML)”.\nIts key design goal was readability, that the language be readable as-is, without looking like it has been marked up with tags or formatting instructions, unlike text formatted with a markup language, such as Rich Text Format (RTF) or HTML, which have obvious tags and formatting instructions. To this end, its main inspiration is the existing conventions for marking up plain text in email, though it also draws from earlier markup languages, notably setext, Textile, and reStructuredText.\nGruber wrote a Perl script, Markdown.pl, which converts marked-up text input to valid, well-formed XHTML or HTML and replaces angle brackets (\u0026lt;, \u0026gt;) and ampersands (\u0026amp;) with their corresponding character entity references. It can take the role of a standalone script, a plugin for Blosxom or a Movable Type, or of a text filter for BBEdit.\nVariants   GitHub Flavored Markdown GitHub had been using its own variant of Markdown since as early as 2009, adding support for additional formatting such as tables and nesting block content inside list elements, as well as GitHub-specific features such as auto-linking references to commits, issues, usernames, etc. In 2017, GitHub released a formal specification of its GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) that is based on CommonMark. It is a strict superset of CommonMark, following its specification exactly except for tables, strikethrough, autolinks and task lists, which GFM adds as extensions. GitHub also changed the parser used on their sites accordingly, which required that some documents be changed. For instance, GFM now requires that the hash symbol that creates a heading be separated from the heading text by a space character.\n  Markdown Extra Markdown Extra is a lightweight markup language based on Markdown implemented in PHP (originally), Python and Ruby. It adds features not available with plain Markdown syntax. Markdown Extra is supported in some content management systems such as, for example, Drupal and TYPO3.\n  LiaScript LiaScript is a Markdown dialect that was designed to create interactive educational content.\n    The template is mobile first with a responsive design to ensure that your site looks stunning on every device.
