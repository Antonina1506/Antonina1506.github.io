      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;brief-information&#34;&gt;Brief information&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first 3 days I was in a small city (town) called Uvarovo. My grandfather lives there. I spend a lot of time outside because the weather was amazing and I tried to relax after hectic days in Moscow. After visiting my grandpa I went to my granny to SaratovThis week the whole country celebrated the 9th of May.. Saratov is quite big and famous city. I really like the architecture of this city and the weather is really nice too. However, when I was there the weather was not really plasant: it was rainy, windy and cold. But it didn&amp;rsquo;t break my plans and I enjoyed talking with my granny about everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-ive-done-these-days&#34;&gt;What I&amp;rsquo;ve done these days&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if I had &amp;ldquo;holidays&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;ve done a lot. Starting with my university studies, I comleted everything for that week for operation systems, prepared for English exam and did some math tasks. I also spend some time doing Korean lessons and started preparation for a new challenge (dialog). Besides, I helped my granny a lot. We&amp;rsquo;ve cut down a tree, which trew the shadow on granny&amp;rsquo;s flowers. Then we cleaned a backyard to prepare it all for summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, I&amp;rsquo;ve done everything that I was planning to do, so I can say that this week was relaxing as well as productive.&lt;/p&gt;
